}

// TimeEntry
class TimeEntry {
  final String id;
  final String employeeId;
  final DateTime clockIn;
  final DateTime? clockOut;
  final String location;
  final TimeEntryType type;

class LeaveRequest {
  final String id;
  final String employeeId;
  final DateTime startDate;
  final DateTime endDate;
